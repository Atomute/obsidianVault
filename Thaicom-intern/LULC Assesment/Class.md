## Road
- the main road is count as one feature and it doesn't include in the test set
	- I think that this big one road feature should break in to multiple feature
## Other
- Human error 
	- the image itself is too hard to tell, even with the human eye
- Solve by select only the feature that you can tell what it is. (?)

## Grass
- 
## Forest
